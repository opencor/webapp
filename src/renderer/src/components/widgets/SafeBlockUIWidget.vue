// This component is a wrapper around PrimeVue's BlockUI. It provides a safe implementation of the block and unblock
// methods that ensure that we don't attempt to block if we are already blocked, and that we properly remove the mask
// when unblocking. This is necessary because PrimeVue's BlockUI does not account for the case where multiple block
// events are emitted before the unblock event is emitted, which can lead to multiple masks being created and not
// properly removed.
// Note: this implementation is based on version 4.2.5 of PrimeVue, which is the version we are using in OpenCOR. If we
//       upgrade to a newer version of PrimeVue, we should check if there are any changes to the BlockUI component that
//       might affect our implementation.
