// Note #1: OpenCOR includes our CellDL runtime, whereas OpenCOR's Web app and our library load a separate build of it
//          at runtime (see vite.celldl.config.ts). OpenCOR's Web app serves it from a same-origin URL (as for
//          libOpenCOR's glue, this is required by its Content Security Policy), whereas our library imports it from
//          https://opencor.ws, unless the host application serves it itself.
// Note #2: our CellDL runtime must use our copy of Vue, which we make available to it before importing it (see
//          sharedVuePlugin() in vite.celldl.config.ts).
// Note #3: our CellDL runtime imports its chunks and assets relative to its own URL, so, unlike libOpenCOR's glue, it
//          cannot be imported from a blob URL. This also means that retrying only helps if our CellDL runtime itself
//          fails to be imported since its chunks keep the same URL from one attempt to another (see attemptUrl()).
