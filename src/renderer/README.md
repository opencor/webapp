# OpenCOR

[OpenCOR](https://opencor.ws/) is a frontend to [libOpenCOR](https://opencor.ws/libopencor/), a library that can be used to organise, edit, simulate, and analyse [CellML](https://cellml.org/) files.

There are two versions of OpenCOR:

1. **OpenCOR:** a desktop application that can be run on [Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_processors)-based and [ARM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family)-based [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows), [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), and [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) machines; and
2. **OpenCOR's Web app:** a [Web app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) that can be run on a Web browser.

Key characteristics:
- Built as a [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) component using the [Composition API](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq).
- Uses [PrimeVue](https://www.primefaces.org/primevue/) as its UI framework.
- Uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
- Can be used as a standalone Web app or embedded in a Vue 3 application.
- Uses [CSS containment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Containment) to prevent CSS leakage when OpenCOR is embedded in an application that doesn't use [PrimeVue](https://www.primefaces.org/primevue/) as its UI framework.

## Deployment

### Cross-origin isolation

OpenCOR's Web app relies on libOpenCOR's threaded WebAssembly (WASM) to run simulations in the browser. Threaded WASM requires [`SharedArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer), which in turn requires the page to be served with **cross-origin isolation** headers.

When deploying OpenCOR's Web app, your Web server **must** send the following headers with the HTML document:

```http
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

Without these headers, OpenCOR's Web app will fail to initialise libOpenCOR and will not function.

The exact steps to set these headers depend on your Web server. Here are the steps for Apache:

1. **Enable `mod_headers`**. Ensure the `headers` module is enabled (e.g., `a2enmod headers` or add it to your modules list).
2. **Set headers on the HTML path**. In your virtual host config, add:

   ```apache
   <Location "/app">
       Header set Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy "same-origin"
       Header set Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy "require-corp"
   </Location>
   ```

   Adjust the `Location` path to match the URL prefix where the Web app is served (here, we use `/app` assuming the Web app is served from `https://your-domain.com/app`).
3. **Reload Apache**. Apply the changes with `sudo apachectl reload` or the equivalent for your distribution.
4. **Verify**. Check the response headers on your deployed HTML page using:

   ```bash
   curl -I https://your-domain.com/app/
   ```

   You should see:

   ```http
   cross-origin-opener-policy: same-origin
   cross-origin-embedder-policy: require-corp
   ```

### libOpenCOR static files

OpenCOR's Web app bundles `libopencor.js` in its static assets during the build process. This file is downloaded from `https://opencor.ws/libopencor/downloads/wasm/<version>/libopencor.js` at build time and placed under the app's `public/` directory. As a result, it is served from the **same origin** as the HTML page, which is needed to run simulations in their own thread.

The threaded WASM file is **not** bundled. Instead, `libopencor.js` dynamically loads it at runtime from:

```
https://opencor.ws/libopencor/downloads/wasm/<version>/libopencor.wasm
```

Because this is a cross-origin request, the server at `opencor.ws` sends the following headers on WASM files:

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin
```

If you wish to self-host the WASM file (e.g., to avoid depending on `opencor.ws`), then you must serve it with the same headers. You can do this by placing a `.htaccess` file in the same directory as the WASM file with the following content:

```apache
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
Header set Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy "require-corp"
Header set Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy "cross-origin"
```

In addition, you will need to update the `locateFile` callback in `src/renderer/src/common/initialisation.ts` to point to your own URL.

### Embedding the `@opencor/opencor` package

The `@opencor/opencor` package does **not** ship `libopencor.js`. At runtime, OpenCOR first tries to import it from your application, using the following URL (relative to your page's base URL):

```
libopencor/downloads/wasm/<version>/libopencor.js
```

where `<version>` is the value of the `libopencorVersion` field in the package's `package.json` file. If your application doesn't serve it, then OpenCOR fetches it from `https://opencor.ws/libopencor/downloads/wasm/<version>/libopencor.js` and imports it from a [blob URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL_static), so that its pthread workers are same-origin. If your application uses a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP), then this requires:

- `connect-src` to allow `https://opencor.ws` (which is needed for the threaded WASM file anyway); and
- `script-src` and `worker-src` to allow `blob:`.

If you would rather not fetch `libopencor.js` from `https://opencor.ws`, then you can self-host it by downloading it from `https://opencor.ws/libopencor/downloads/wasm/<version>/libopencor.js` and serving it, as a JavaScript file, from the above URL. Note that `worker-src` must still allow `blob:` since, on the Web, `libopencor.js` always spawns its pthread workers from blob URLs. Make sure to do this again whenever you update the `@opencor/opencor` package, since `<version>` will then change.

## Usage

OpenCOR accepts the following props:

| Name    | Type                                | Default    | Description                                                                             |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `omex`  | `string` \| `Uint8Array`            | `null`     | The [OMEX file](https://combinearchive.org/) to use, as a URL string or raw OMEX bytes. |
| `theme` | `'light'` \| `'dark'` \| `'system'` | `'system'` | The theme to use.                                                                       |

- **main.ts:**

```typescript
import { createApp } from 'vue';

import App from './App.vue';

createApp(App).mount('#app');
```

### No `omex` prop provided

When no `omex` prop is provided, the component gives access to all of OpenCOR's features.

- **App.vue:**

```vue
<template>
  <OpenCOR />
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import OpenCOR from '@opencor/opencor';
import '@opencor/opencor/style.css';
</script>
```

### `omex` prop provided

When an `omex` prop is provided, the component goes straight into OpenCOR's simulation mode, using the specified OMEX file.

- **App.vue:**

```vue
<template>
  <OpenCOR omex="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencor/webapp/refs/heads/main/tests/models/ui/lorenz.omex" />
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import OpenCOR from '@opencor/opencor';
import '@opencor/opencor/style.css';
</script>
```

- **Exposed methods:**

  OpenCOR always exposes the following method:

  - `changelog()`: returns the changes for all the versions of OpenCOR up to the current one, as an array of `{ version: string; changes: { type: 'added' | 'removed' | 'improved' | 'fixed'; description: string }[] }` objects (see `IOpenCORChangelogEntry`), from the newest version to the oldest one.

  OpenCOR also always exposes the following methods, which only have an effect when an `omex` prop is provided:

  - `trackSimulationData(modelParameters: string[])`: adds the given parameter names to the list of tracked simulation data.
  - `untrackSimulationData(modelParameters: string[])`: removes the given parameter names from the list of tracked simulation data.
  - `untrackAllSimulationData()`: clears the list of tracked simulation data.

  A parameter name is a string that identifies a parameter in the model and consists of the component in which the parameter is located and the name of the parameter itself, separated by a slash. For instance, `main/x` identifies the `x` parameter in the `main` component.
